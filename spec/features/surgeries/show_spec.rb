# User Story 2 ,
# Surgery Show Page
# As a visitor
# When I visit the surgery index page
# I can click on any surgery title to take me to that surgeryâ€™s show page
# And on the show page I see the title and operating room number of that surgery

# And I see the count of doctors that are on this surgery

# And I see a section of the page that says "Other surgeries happening this day of the week:"
# And under that header I see titles of all surgeries that happen on the same day of the week as this surgery.
